# Description

These are small side projects that I worked on for the fun of seeing what JavaScript can do. They also served to benefit me through giving me practice. 

Some of the projects started as coursework in various classes, from SkillCrush, Udacity, and some were just to see if I could make them work the way that I envisioned.
